Increase Occupancy Rate:
Enhancing the occupancy rate is crucial for boosting profitability. 
By ensuring more seats are filled on each flight, we can maximize revenue and reduce the impact of operational challenges.
This involves identifying low-performing routes and implementing targeted marketing campaigns, offering discounts, or adjusting flight schedules to better match demand.
Increasing occupancy will help optimize the use of resources and improve overall financial performance.

Improve Pricing Strategy: 
Developing a dynamic and flexible pricing strategy is essential in responding to changing market conditions and customer preferences. 
This strategy should include real-time price adjustments based on factors such as demand fluctuations, competitive pricing, and seasonal trends. 
Implementing advanced pricing algorithms and data analytics can help set competitive yet profitable prices, attracting and retaining customers while ensuring maximum revenue per seat.

Enhance Customer Experience: 
Providing an exceptional customer experience from the booking process to arrival is key to differentiating ourselves in a competitive industry. 
This includes streamlining the booking process, offering personalized services, ensuring timely and efficient check-in and boarding procedures, and enhancing in-flight services.
A seamless and enjoyable experience will not only attract new customers but also build loyalty among existing ones, leading to repeat business and positive word-of-mouth referrals.
